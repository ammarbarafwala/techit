# TechITApp
TechIT on the phone.

This application allows a technician to access the TechIT service. Thet will be able to create, modify and take a ticket that has been created by by the user. 

This application is still under development. The current version allows the technician to login using their CSULA portal accounts. The technician first must be assigned as technicians by the system administrator before using this app.
